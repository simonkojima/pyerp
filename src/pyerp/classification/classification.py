    Parameters
    ----------
    times : list-like | float | int
        List of numbers or a number representing points in time.
    t_ref : float | int
        time reference to compute index of each time point.
        usually, it is the first time index of concerned data.
    sfreq : float | int
        sampling frequency of concerned data.
    use_rounding : bool
        If True, use rounding (instead of truncation) when converting
        times to indices. This can help avoid non-unique indices.

    -------
    index : ndarray
        Indices corresponding to the times supplied.
