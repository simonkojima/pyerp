    compute ITR (Information Transfer Rate).

    Parameters
    ==========
    n_classes : int
        Number of classes of bci system
    accuracy : float
        Classification accuracy
    trial_duration : float, default=None
        Time duration of single trial in minutes. If it's NOT None, ITR will be returned in unit of (bits/min).
        Otherwise, it will be (bit/trial). Default value is None.
